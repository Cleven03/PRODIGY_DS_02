# PRODIGY_DS_02
I am an Intern in Prodigy InfoTech and i have copmleted the task using google colab  in 13 -15 days. 

Task 2 :Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Task Overview
the structured approach to data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset, which is a popular dataset for practicing data analysis and machine learning techniques. Below, I will outline the steps involved in this process, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and insights derived from the data.

## Dataset
The Dataset used for this task is titanic.csv from kaggle.com

## Conclusion
Through this EDA, the cleaned the Titanic dataset, explored various relationships between variables, and identified significant patterns regarding survival rates based on gender, passenger class, and age. This analysis can serve as a foundation for further modeling and predictive analysis.
